# QuizzApp

QuizzApp is a dynamic, feature-rich quiz application built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**. It enables users to take quizzes with questions fetched from Firebase Firestore, provides a countdown timer for each question, and displays a final result with a celebratory confetti effect for the user’s score.

## Features

- **Quiz Questions from Firestore**: The app dynamically fetches quiz questions and options from Firestore, making it flexible to update quizzes without updating the app.
- **Countdown Timer**: Each question comes with a 30-second countdown timer. The next question is loaded automatically when the timer reaches zero.
- **Progress Indicator**: A visual progress bar increases as the countdown progresses, providing a visual cue for the remaining time.
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Each question includes four possible answers displayed as radio buttons.
- **Result Page with Score**: At the end of the quiz, the user is redirected to a results page displaying the total score (correct answers out of total questions).
- **Confetti Celebration**: A confetti effect celebrates the user’s score on the results screen.
- **Responsive and Attractive UI**: The app is designed with a clean and interactive user interface, with an SVG background and smooth animations.
